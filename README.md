# Scratch-Map

### This project is live [here](https://oisin-m.github.io/Animate-Your-Travels/)

This is the final and best iteration of my exploits in trying to build a scratch map app. I tried out a number of different previous version using various different libraries:
- Highcharts: https://github.com/Oisin-M/Highcharts-Scratch-Map
- Amcharts: https://github.com/Oisin-M/Ionic-Amcharts-Scratch-Map
- Maphael: https://github.com/Oisin-M/Maphael-Scratch-Map

In the end I settled on using Highcharts along with Ionic (via CDN), though it is worth noting that the Highcharts library is only free for non-commercial use such as this.

The Scratch Map allows you to add countries by dropdown or by clicking, and notifies you when a country has been added.

I have also built a feature to allow you to animate your travels.
